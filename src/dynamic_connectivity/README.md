# Dynamic connectivity problem

The dynamic connectivity problem, the model of the problem for Union-Find. 
The idea: There is a set of N objects, doesn't really matter what they are, we're going to use the numbers zero through N to model our objects.
And then we have the idea of a connection between two objects.
We'll postulate that there's going to be a command that says: connect two objects. 
The key part of the problem is the find query, or the connected query, which just asks: is there a path connecting the two objects?


These are used:
1. Pixels in a digital photo,
2. Computers in the network,
3. Friends in the social network,
4. Transistors in the computer chip,
5. Elements in mathematical set,
6. etc.
